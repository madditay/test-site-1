#A Casual Update
Good afternoon, gentle readers.
As the end of the semester approaches, I look back on the teachings and skills I've garnered over the past several months.
My technical abilities have greatly improved with the practice faciliated through both SI676 and SI504. 
I am confident in my capabilities on the command line, my prowess in building sites of different varieties, and understanding of how GitHub operates. 
Should I need to utilize these skills in the future, I am confident that I would be able to perform. 
Stay tuned for updates regarding highlighted activities from my educational journey - it should be quite the experience!
Regards,
Madison Haack
